\title{Postprocessing and univariate analysis of omics data}
\description{
The 'phenomis' package provides methods to perform post-processing (i.e. 
quality control and normalization) as well as univariate statistical analysis
of single and multi-omics data sets. These methods include quality control 
metrics, signal drift and batch effect correction, intensity transformation, 
univariate hypothesis testing, but also clustering (as well as annotation of 
metabolomics data). The data are handled in the standard Bioconductor formats
(i.e. SummarizedExperiment and MultiAssayExperiment for single and 
multi-omics datasets, respectively; the alternative ExpressionSet and 
MultiDataSet formats are also supported for convenience). As a result, all 
methods can be readily chained as workflows. The pipeline can be further 
enriched by multivariate analysis and feature selection, by using the 
'ropls' and biosigner' packages, which support the same formats. Data can be 
conveniently imported from and exported to text files. Although the methods 
were initially targeted to metabolomics data, most of the methods can be 
applied to other types of omics data (e.g., transcriptomics, proteomics).
